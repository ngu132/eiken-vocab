       " 'Reproducibility is a cornerstone of science, yet a growing chorus of researchers have claimed that numerous experiments, even ones carried out by esteemed psychologists and reported in prestigious journals, cannot be successfully replicated. One notable example is a widely cited piece of psychological research claiming that completing word puzzles designed to evoke images associated with old age caused the experiment\\'s subjects to walk more slowly afterward. However, it has never been successfully confirmed by other researchers. Defenders of studies that came under fire when they could not be replicated, however, presented a host of possible explanations for the inconsistencies, alleging that the researchers who attempted the replications lacked the necessary competence, or claiming that sample sizes in the follow-ups had been insufficient. In response, a project was undertaken under the direction of University of Virginia researcher Brian Nosek in the 2010s that put nearly 100 celebrated psychology studies to the test by attempting to reproduce them. The results were startling: only about half the studies investigated made the grade, highlighting what has been dubbed psychology\\'s \"replication crisis.\" While there have been cases of outright fraud and complaints that journals tend to favor studies that confirm the researchers\\' hypothesis, perhaps the most disturbing trend revealed in the wake of Nosek\\'s study is what is known as \"p-hacking.\" This is coined from the statistical term \"p-value,\" which is calculated by researchers to show the probability that their experimental results are actually being produced by the effect they are studying rather than by random chance or some other factor. In their quest to obtain an acceptable p-value, researchers have been accused of omitting undesirable data, choosing statistical tests that are more likely to confirm their desired results, and being selective about which observations are compared with each other. In one survey, over 40 percent of psychology researchers admitted to some form of p-hacking, and, astonishingly, the majority felt their research methods were defensible because they were carrying out practices that are well established, and even taught, in the profession. This is what makes p-hacking so insidious. The combined effect of fraud, publication bias, and p-hacking has caused many to question the validity of psychology studies appearing in well-known textbooks and journals. While some researchers worry the crisis will reduce their field to the status of pseudoscientific nonsense, others have noted that it could be beneficial. The follow-up testing conducted in Nosek\\'s study that brought the validity of psychological research into question actually demonstrates that lab experiments, when conducted to the highest standards of practice, are a valid method of studying human behavior. In addition, the reproduction of some original findings helps validate the theories behind them. Nosek says studies like the ones in his project are usually overlooked because \"the incentives for individual scientists prioritize novelty over replication.\" He suggests that enticements such as publication and funding should be geared equally toward rewarding both new discoveries and the substantiation of previous ones.',\n",

As a result, nationalists were able to blame labor organizations, socialists, and the country\\'s Jewish population for the seemingly disadvantageous terms the Treaty of Versailles imposed on Germany. The most infamous section of the treaty was Article 231, commonly known as the \"war guilt clause.\" It established Germany\\'s responsibility for its actions as a basis for surrendering territory and making financial reparations. Nationalists, bitter from the German defeat, however, condemned it and claimed the reparation costs demanded by the Triple Entente were so excessive that they impoverished the nation. When read in context, though, it becomes evident that, rather than condemning Germany for the outbreak of hostilities, Article 231 primarily served to establish that Germany was legally obligated to abide by the demands for reparations laid out in other articles of the treaty, one of which actually limited Germany\\'s responsibility mainly to paying for damage incurred by civilians. The clause is therefore more accurately viewed as part of a concession to Germany by the victors. When Adolf Hitler\\'s Nazi Party took power in the 1930s, it claimed Germany, as a victim of the terms imposed by the Treaty of Versailles, had become an international outcast. Playing on the notion of Article 231 as a war guilt clause, the Nazis fanned the flames of German resentment. Their claim was adopted in many historical narratives and taken as fact by influential individuals, like Britain\\'s wartime prime minister David Lloyd George, who joined in laying much of the blame for Germany\\'s renewed postwar militarism on the legacy of the Treaty of Versailles. In fact, this interpretation is still commonly cited as a key cause of World War II. It can be argued, however, that the Nazis had it entirely backwards. Their illegal rearmament and seizure of territory, which violated the Treaty of Versailles, were the true impetus for Germany\\'s exclusion from the international community. Perhaps it is time to relegate Article 231\\'s label as the \"war guilt clause\" to simply a footnote of history.',\n",
       " 'When Peru achieved its independence from Spain in the 1820s, it was beset by economic woes. The hard-fought war for freedom had damaged the trade in silver between the two countries, leading to the collapse of the silver mines that had been the backbone of Peru\\'s economy. The conflict had also put the country in massive debt to British bankers, from whom the Peruvian government had borrowed heavily to fund its war effort. Struggling unsuccessfully to develop its economy for two decades following independence, Peru was eventually handed a glimmer of hope in the form of an unlikely resource: seabird manure. This waste product, known as guano, had accumulated in enormous mounds on the Chincha Islands off the country\\'s coast. Its shores, drenched in nourishing waters flowing from the Pacific Ocean and teeming with various marine species, attracted a large predatory bird population. The combination of cool ocean currents and warm tropical air created an exceedingly arid environment, ensuring that the abundant nutrients naturally present in the guano were not dispersed by precipitation. The particularly high nitrogen content in guano, in fact, is what made the waste material an ideal fertilizer. Indigenous peoples had been using the guano sustainably as such for centuries, carefully timing its extraction from the islands so as not to disturb the seabird populations and penalizing anyone who harmed the birds during mating season with death. Guano was not widely appreciated in Europe, however, until 1838, when two businessmen in Peru sent samples to Britain, where farmers soon noted its effect on depleted soil. The surge in demand for food caused by an enormous population boom had led to unsustainable farming practices, while the population shift from rural to urban areas driven by industrialization meant human waste wound up in cities rather than being returned to farmland to be used as fertilizer, as had previously been the case. Guano proved a magic bullet to invigorate the degraded soil. By 1841, trade in the product between Peru and Britain was well underway, ushering in the Guano Age. The Peruvian government enjoyed a monopoly over the Chincha Islands\\' guano, but the country lacked both the capital and the expertise to effectively manage international shipping and sales. Consequently, these were consigned to British merchants, who received a substantial commission for their efforts. Furthermore, payment was not rendered to the Peruvian government until transactions were finalized, a rather lengthy process considering that loading one ship could take well over a month. Rampant corruption among the ruling class only made matters worse, and although much money had been poured into various public projects, little had been spent on efforts to diversify and stabilize the economy in the long term. The guano-driven \"prosperity\" Peru enjoyed eventually proved painfully finite. Ravaged by the guano trade, the Chincha Islands\\' once-gigantic mounds of manure that had formed over thousands of years were almost depleted by the 1870s, and the seabirds relied on for replenishing the supply had been largely driven away or killed after decades of incessant extraction. The shortage spelled economic disaster for Peru, whose lack of economic prudence left it no better off after the guano boom than it had been before it. Swedish historian Magnus Mrner, echoing the opinion of many scholars, stated that, for Peru, \"guano wealth was, on the whole, a developmental opportunity missed.\"',\n",

As a result, nationalists were able to blame labor organizations, socialists, and the country\\'s Jewish population for the seemingly disadvantageous terms the Treaty of Versailles imposed on Germany. The most infamous section of the treaty was Article 231, commonly known as the \"war guilt clause.\" It established Germany\\'s responsibility for its actions as a basis for surrendering territory and making financial reparations. Nationalists, bitter from the German defeat, however, condemned it and claimed the reparation costs demanded by the Triple Entente were so excessive that they impoverished the nation. When read in context, though, it becomes evident that, rather than condemning Germany for the outbreak of hostilities, Article 231 primarily served to establish that Germany was legally obligated to abide by the demands for reparations laid out in other articles of the treaty, one of which actually limited Germany\\'s responsibility mainly to paying for damage incurred by civilians. The clause is therefore more accurately viewed as part of a concession to Germany by the victors. When Adolf Hitler\\'s Nazi Party took power in the 1930s, it claimed Germany, as a victim of the terms imposed by the Treaty of Versailles, had become an international outcast. Playing on the notion of Article 231 as a war guilt clause, the Nazis fanned the flames of German resentment. Their claim was adopted in many historical narratives and taken as fact by influential individuals, like Britain\\'s wartime prime minister David Lloyd George, who joined in laying much of the blame for Germany\\'s renewed postwar militarism on the legacy of the Treaty of Versailles. In fact, this interpretation is still commonly cited as a key cause of World War II. It can be argued, however, that the Nazis had it entirely backwards. Their illegal rearmament and seizure of territory, which violated the Treaty of Versailles, were the true impetus for Germany\\'s exclusion from the international community. Perhaps it is time to relegate Article 231\\'s label as the \"war guilt clause\" to simply a footnote of history.',\n",
       " \"When Peru achieved its independence from Spain in the 1820s, it was beset by economic woes. The hard-fought war for freedom had damaged the trade in silver between the two countries, leading to the collapse of the silver mines that had been the backbone of Peru's economy. The conflict had also put the country in massive debt to British bankers, from whom the Peruvian government had borrowed heavily to fund its war effort. Struggling unsuccessfully to develop its economy for two decades following independence, Peru was eventually handed a glimmer of hope in the form of an unlikely resource: seabird manure. This waste product, known as guano, had accumulated in enormous mounds on the Chincha Islands off the country's coast. Its shores, drenched in nourishing waters flowing from the Pacific Ocean and teeming with various marine species, attracted a large predatory bird population. The combination of cool ocean currents and warm tropical air created an exceedingly arid environment, ensuring that the abundant nutrients naturally present in the guano were not dispersed by precipitation. The particularly high nitrogen content in guano, in fact, is what made the waste material an ideal fertilizer. Indigenous peoples had been using the guano sustainably as such for centuries, carefully timing its extraction from the islands so as not to disturb the seabird populations and penalizing anyone who harmed the birds during mating season with death. Guano was not widely appreciated in Europe, however, until 1838, when two businessmen in Peru sent samples to Britain, where farmers soon noted its effect on depleted soil. The surge in demand for food caused by an enormous population boom had led to unsustainable farming practices, while the population shift from rural to urban areas driven by industrialization meant human waste wound up in cities rather than being returned to farmland to be used as fertilizer, as had previously been the case. Guano proved a magic bullet to invigorate the degraded soil. By 1841, trade in the product between Peru and Britain was well underway, ushering in the Guano Age. The Peruvian government enjoyed a monopoly over the Chincha Islands' guano, but the country lacked both the capital and the expertise to effectively manage international shipping and sales. Consequently, these were consigned to British merchants, who received a substantial commission for their efforts.\",\n",
       " 'Rampant corruption among the ruling class only made matters worse, and although much money had been poured into various public projects, little had been spent on efforts to diversify and stabilize the economy in the long term. The guano-driven \"prosperity\" Peru enjoyed eventually proved painfully finite. Ravaged by the guano trade, the Chincha Islands\\' once-gigantic mounds of manure that had formed over thousands of years were almost depleted by the 1870s, and the seabirds relied on for replenishing the supply had been largely driven away or killed after decades of incessant extraction. The shortage spelled economic disaster for Peru, whose lack of economic prudence left it no better off after the guano boom than it had been before it. Swedish historian Magnus Mrner, echoing the opinion of many scholars, stated that, for Peru, \"guano wealth was, on the whole, a developmental opportunity missed.\"']"

Of course, you can't go wrong with traditional plate service, and our Elegant Plan never fails to impress. With this option, guests choose their main dish, and you'll have more control over the menu. Please note this plan requires four months' notice. Next is our Country Plan, which provides a buffet-style meal. This plan is our most expensive, as more food is prepared, but a beautifully arranged buffet adds a striking visual touch to any reception and leaves plenty of room on each table. Finally, with our Star Plan, guests serve themselveswith some helpat various food stations.

Glen would've been ideal since he managed the previous project, and everybody likes him. He's just been assigned to another project, though. Keiko just joined us last month, but she led several similar projects at her last job. And I think she's even more outgoing and approachable than Glen. Then, there's Jamie. She sometimes struggles a bit due to a lack of familiarity with our systems. That being said, she's got fantastic people skills and was a good team player in the last project. If Terence were a bit less introverted, he'd be excellent because he knows everything there is to know about coding.

       "  'Roland Barthes and \"The Death of the Author\" Published in 1967, Roland Barthes\\'s essay \"The Death of the Author\" was an assault on traditional literary criticism, which had held that a work of literature reflected the vision of its author. Proponents of this view emphasized, among other things, that examination of the author\\'s biographical details was necessary to understand a text. Barthes, however, contended that__. Even literary works written anonymously, he argued, possess meaning regardless of whether the author\\'s identity is known. According to Barthes, a text\\'s meaning is a product of the language in which it is written as well as the associations made by its readers, not just the ideas the author intended to convey. Thus, for Barthes critics who attempt to explain works based on the supposed intentions of their authors do little more than repeat what he describes as \"tyrannical\" literary traditions. Barthes\\'s essay has been criticized as an overreaction to the dominance of author-focused criticism in his time. While few now go as far as Barthes in rejecting the author as a relevant source of meaning, his ideas have encouraged a more balanced approach that considers both the intentions of authors and the contributions of readers to the creation of meaning.',\n",

These armored vehicles were practically immune to the machine-gun fire that frequently mowed down waves of troops, and they could penetrate the barbed wire and lines of trenches the Germans had thought impregnable. Britain utilized hundreds of tanks in the assault, which led to an unprecedented advance of six miles and briefly appeared to have broken the long-existing stalemate between the opposing armies. With so many tanks involved in the assault, however, little was left in the way of reserves; a fact painfully realized after tanks on the front line broke down and needed maintenance or replacing. The difficulty in replenishing infantry and exhausted crewmen due to poor weather only made things worse, and with a majority of tanks out of commission, the attack stalled, allowing the Germans to retake territory.',\n",

Since the similarity between missiles and space rockets meant that improvements in the latter would benefit the development of the former, the Soviets' initial lead in the Space Race represented an existential threat to the Americans. Although the Soviets had launched the first manned space mission in 1961, a combination of factors resulted in their lead being squandered. First, there was a tremendous clash of objectives between the military, which provided funding for space exploration, and rival factions within the government. After US president John F. Kennedy announced in 1961 that the United States would reach the moon before the decade ended, bureaucratic infighting within the Soviet Union led to the nation's financial resources being allocated to a wider range of projects. Many of these were purely military rather than exploratory, resulting in fewer available funds for a moon mission. Furthermore, despite the Soviet Union's determination to outperform the United States, its leader, Nikita Khrushchev, did not order a moon mission until 1964, months after the United States had tested the module that would carry its astronauts to the moon. Another major cause of the Soviet Union's failure is an ironic one. The Space Race was part of the Cold War, a decades-long rivalry between the capitalist, democratic United States and the Communist Soviet Union. Early on, however, the United States formed NASA to provide a top-down organization answerable to the federal governmenta model that would not be out of place in a Communist state. In contrast, the competing jumble of organizations and factions involved in the Soviet space program corresponded more closely to what one would anticipate in a capitalist system. For example, two prominent rocket engineers, Sergei Korolev and Valentin Glushko, came into conflict over what type of fuel to use, and an official commission ruled in favor of Korolev's proposal. Glushko, however, used his connections in government to organize a parallel project that diverted already scarce resources away from Korolev's plan. Eventually, the organizational problems and policy failures of the Soviet space program culminated in the rocket it intended to use to take astronauts to the moon experiencing disastrous technical failures, allowing the United States to complete its own moon mission.\",\n",

       "  \"In the aftermath of the dramatic collapse of the Holy Roman Empire during the Napoleonic Wars of the early nineteenth century, the political landscape of Central Europe underwent a profound transformation. The territories that had composed the once-mighty empire eventually evolved into a diverse coalition of thirty-nine German-speaking kingdoms, free cities, and other states known collectively as the German Confederation. Although there was significant interest in the concept of forming a German nation, fragmentation and discord within this new alliance meant that achieving a cohesive state remained elusive for many decades. In the 1860s, however, the shrewd statesman Otto von Bismarck became the prime minister of Prussia, a German kingdom that competed with Austria for dominance in the German Confederation. During his early days in politics, the conservative Bismarck had held deep-seated apprehensions that unification would lead to the demise of Prussia's identity, and he had thus accepted Austria's prevailing supremacy within the German Confederation. With the passage of time, though, Bismarck came to consider Prussia's deference to Austria humiliating and feared his nation would lose its standing within the region. He eventually became the leading advocate of unification, embracing a vision of a new German state dominated by Prussia. Bismarck was a practitioner of what is known as realpolitik, a pragmatic approach to diplomacy and statecraft that focuses on strategic objectives and national interest at the expense of ideological and ethical considerations. Bismarck repeatedly demonstrated his mastery of realpolitik in his efforts to achieve his political objectives. First, upon taking power, Bismarck found himself in conflict with the liberal majority in the lower house of Prussia's legislature over issues related to the nation's military budget. He soon realized, however, that a diplomatic dispute with Denmark had potential as both a distraction from the budget issue and a means to advance the cause of German unification. At the time, Denmark was attempting to incorporate a section of Schleswig-Holstein, a member of the German Confederation, into its territory. Though even the Prussian monarch admitted that his nation had no legitimate claims on Schleswig-Holstein, Bismarck saw an opportunity to exploit outrage regarding Denmark's actions among members of the German Confederation, and he launched a successful military campaign that wrested control of it from Denmark, expanding both Prussian territory and influence. Two years later, Bismarck again utilized realpolitik, isolating rival Austria diplomatically to allow Prussia to go to war with it without bringing powers like France and Russia into the conflict. This second Prussian triumph allowed Prussia to annex more territory and relegated Austria to the status of a second-rate state that was so focused on internal issues that it was no longer a threat. In the wake of the conflict, the North German Confederation, a relatively unified collection of twenty-two states, was formed, with Prussia playing a dominant role. Both these actions served to increase popular support for the formation of a German state and undermine liberal opposition to Prussia's military expansion. While the North German Confederation was an important step toward unification, it could not become a reality without the southern German states, which were hesitant to enter into a political union. Bismarck, however, realized that the southern German states' treaties specifying military cooperation with Prussia could be manipulated to overcome their reluctance. Therefore, he utilized realpolitik again, resorting to purposely inflaming tensions with France, the common enemy of the German states. He did so by crafting a diplomatic incident, selectively modifying key phrases and omitting context in an important diplomatic telegram, deliberately provoking outrage in France, all the while insisting that he was doing his utmost to avoid conflict. The telegram caused the French emperor Napoleon III to initiate hostilities with Prussia, proving once again Bismarck's aptitude for diplomatic manipulation. The southern German states came to the aid of Prussia's North German Confederation, and France was soundly vanquished. The combination of Bismarck's superb political maneuvering and the three armed conflicts that had brought unity to the once-fragmented German-speaking territories finally resulted in German unification in 1871. The ceremony, however, took place at the Palace of Versailles, near Paris, rather than in Berlin, which had been the capital of Prussia. According to historian Katja Hoyer, formalizing the unification within the borders of any German state would have fomented envy and resentment among the others. Furthermore, she argues that the choice to hold it in the nation that it had just defeated reflected the fact that military struggle had been at the core of Germany's formation.\",\n",

The Ogallala Aquifer lies beneath a large area of land that includes parts of eight states in the central United States. An aquifer is an underground layer of rock that is saturated with water and serves as a source of fresh water for wells and springs. The Ogallala Aquifer is crucial for the region's economy, as agriculture is dependent upon the water it provides for irrigation. Because the region is relatively dry, water has been pumped from the aquifer at high rates primarily for agricultural use but also for drinking and other purposes since the mid-twentieth century. Excessive removal of water from the aquifer, however, has led water levels to decline significantly. In some places, levels have dropped by more than sixty meters. As a result, the future usability of the aquifer as a water source is now uncertain. The region supplied by the aquifer is an important producer of agricultural goods, many of which are exported abroad. This means if the aquifer runs dry, there would not only be significant effects on the regional economy, but the resulting reduction in agricultural exports could also cause a rise in the prices of food in countries around the world. Some states where the Ogallala Aquifer is a key water resource have enacted legislation to address the problem. It has limited the amount of water farmers can pump from the aquifer. This includes forcing farmers to install devices that measure water usage. However, these changes have angered farmers in the region who need a lot of water to maintain crop production at economically sustainable levels. The farmers also say having to install costly meters in their wells is hurting them financially. On top of this, restricting access to the water below farmland may make it less valuable real estate. These factors combined have many farmers concerned that their farms may be unable to continue into the future.\",\n",

Recent research, however, has questioned this assumption. A study by researcher Chris Fraley, for example, has suggested that children raised by strict, authoritarian parents often have conservative views as adults. On the other hand, children who grow up in households where they are given more freedom and allowed to express their opinions tend to identify themselves as liberal when they reach adulthood. Other researchers have found evidence that the reasons for one\\'s political beliefs are at least partially biological. For instance, a study by two political scientists demonstrated that conservatives tend to react faster and more intensely than liberals to negative stimuli such as shocking photos. This \"negativity bias,\" the scientists say, appears to be hard-wired into the brain. Moreover, DNA comparisons in another study also indicated that liberals and conservatives have differences in certain genes that affect how the brain reacts to threats or how open it is to new ideas. It is therefore possible that nature, as well as nurture, shapes our political beliefs.',\n",
       "  'According to the US Census Bureau, people living in married households in the US are now outnumbered by those living in other types of household arrangements. Various factors are responsible for this change, including the tendency of younger adults to live together before getting married. The senior-citizen demographic is another factor behind the change, because when one spouse dies, a \"single-person household\" is created. For a number of reasons, including greater wealth, elderly people who lose a spouse are tending to live on their own rather than move in with their families as they may have in the past. What is more, elderly people are less likely to remarry than younger adults are. Another notable fact is that college graduates tend to postpone marriage until they have greater financial stability. Reduced job opportunities and lower salaries also seem to be making it harder for some people with less education to get married and start a family.',\n",

       "  'In 1952, a group of army officers seized power from the British-backed monarchy in Egypt, forcing the nation\\'s king, Farouk I, into exile. The rebels were part of a nationalist movement within the military forces of Egypt, known as the Free Officers, which had formed around the anticolonialist ideology of its leader, a young Egyptian officer named Gamal Abdel Nasser. Its official head at the time of the coup was Mohammed Naguib, a senior army officer and war hero, whom Nasser installed as a figurehead. Nasser was taking advantage of Naguib\\'s tremendous renown among the general public to legitimize the new regime since he himself lacked the prestige necessary for the role at the time. When Naguib overstepped his bounds by attempting to defy Nasser, however, he was removed from power and Nasser emerged from the shadows, assuming the country\\'s leadership in 1954. During his long years in power, Nasser remade Egypt. He instituted a far-reaching modernization program that included free education and medical care, improved housing, and labor reforms. A feudal system of land ownership during the monarchy had created an unequal distribution of wealth, which Nasser addressed with reforms that improved conditions for farmers and limited the amount of land individuals could own. Nasser came from humble beginnings and presented himself as a man of the people. \"Nasserism,\" as his ideology became known, was rooted in socialism and wealth redistribution, and unlike previous rulers, Nasser remained free of corruption. This is not to say, however, that his rule was benign. Dissent was mercilessly crushed, and Nasser expressed open contempt for democracy. He saw both his egalitarian social programs and harsh enforcement tactics as essential for attaining his vision of Arab unity, or pan-Arabism, across the Middle East. If Egypt were to take the dominant role in a unified Arab world, it would first have to bolster its economy and improve social welfare domestically while ensuring that any opponents who might undermine Nasser\\'s policies were kept off the political stage. Anticolonialism was the foundation of Nasser\\'s foreign policy, and he supported liberation movements throughout Africa. Aided by his charisma and public-speaking talents, Nasser not only transformed Egyptian society but also provided a model to which other Arab nations could aspire. Nasser stepped into the international spotlight in 1956, when he nationalized the strategically and economically important Suez Canal. Despite its location within Egyptian territory, it had been jointly owned and operated by Britain and France, but Egyptian soldiers seized control of the canal. Israeli, French, and British forces invaded the country, quickly defeating Egyptian forces in the Suez region and precipitating what became known as the \"Suez Crisis.\" Egypt enjoyed greater success on the diplomatic front, however. The Soviet Union was courting Egyptian favor at the time with a view to greater influence in the region in the future, and condemned what it saw as an example of Western imperialism. The Soviets even went so far as to threaten a nuclear strike against Western Europe if the invaders failed to withdraw. A horrified United States intervened behind the scenes to avert a confrontation with the Soviets, resulting in a humiliating withdrawal by the European and Israeli invaders. Nasser emerged from the Suez Crisis having not only defied the West but triumphed against long odds, albeit due in part to the fortuitous intercession of the Americans and Soviets. Nasser\\'s actions nonetheless resulted in mass displays of public adulation throughout the Middle East and the consolidation of his leadership role within it. At the height of Nasser\\'s power, Arab unity seemed a genuine possibility. Having shaken off colonial rule, nations in the Middle East stood together in solidarity and identified as an independent geopolitical bloc. Yet the 1958 formation of the United Arab Republic, a union between Egypt and Syria, was short-lived owing to Syrian dissatisfaction with Nasser-imposed centralization policies. The notion that Arab nations could unify was smashed in 1967, when Egypt led surrounding Arab countries into a disastrous war with Israel, the result of which was not only a significant loss of territory but also a deep, abiding wound inflicted upon the Arab psyche. Nasser\\'s popularity waned in the years before his death in 1970, but he remains an icon to many throughout the Middle East, even though disunity and conflict today have lessened the prospect of pan-Arabism. In post-Nasser Egypt, the gulf between rich and poor continues to fluctuate, and Nasser\\'s goal of social equality appears unlikely to come to fruition. Despite the nostalgia for Nasser\\'s rule, however, some commentators insist his charisma made Egyptians blind to his failings, such as the fact that his wealth-redistribution policies encouraged an economic overreliance on the state by the work force which continues to this day. While there is truth in such accusations, in the end, since Nasser\\'s popularity has always been primarily a product of his ideology rather than his accomplishments, the nostalgia will likely endure for years to come.',\n",

       "  \"Beneath globalization's seemingly positive effects of international trade and integrated markets lie worrying issues. Centralized authoritative bodies, suppression of local economies, and the exploitation of foreign labor are just some of the problems accompanying a more globalized world. As economies grow more interconnected, further regulation of trade and business becomes necessary. More powerful nations, however, are often quick to seize upon this by establishing central trade commissions and all-encompassing laws, leading to smaller countries having less autonomy to make their own decisions regarding how money, labor, and products flow through their economies. In addition to drawing power away from developing countries, globalization also stifles their local economies. The rising desirability of certain products grants corporations that create them greater financial leverage to purchase land and materials in poorer countries. By doing so, corporations appropriate valuable local resources for foreign markets that could be better used for local consumption. Even more concerning is the treatment of foreign labor. Manufacturing is often outsourced to poorer countries to slash costs, which, some argue, provides jobs for low-income communities. In reality, this fosters an unhealthy reliance on large companies, which are then free to exploit local laborincluding childrenwith low wages and poor conditions. From the perspective of developing countries, it is clear the problems arising from one-sided regulatory pressure, monopolization of smaller economies, and the abuse of poor, vulnerable workers are aspects of globalization that, if ignored, will only continue to worsen.\",\n",

       "  'A report by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) revealed that governments provided $5.2 trillion in subsidies to fossil-fuel companies in 2017. In light of evidence that fossil-fuel-related pollution causes millions of deaths each year, supporting the use of fossil fuels appears both morally questionable and in direct opposition to government pledges to reduce carbon emissions. However, the subsidy total is misleading in that it includes both pretax and posttax subsidies. The former are what most people associate with the word \"subsidy\"things like cash handouts and tax breaks for oil companies that are designed to lower the cost of production, resulting in lower prices for consumers. The vast majority of the subsidies in the report, however, are of the posttax variety. These represent the additional burden on taxpayers that is the consequence of our dependence on fossil fuelseverything from oil-spill cleanup bills to increased traffic congestion and road accidents. Numerous critics contest the IMF\\'s definition of subsidies, pointing out that there is obviously a high degree of subjectivity with regard to whether such costs should be included in these calculations. When posttax subsidies are excluded, the amount decreases to $424 billion, a fraction of the original sum. While the inclusion of posttax subsidies may have been deceptive, a closer look at their societal costs is troubling. Many in society indeed gain an advantage from the economic and lifestyle benefits afforded from consumption of fossil-fuel-based energy, but the approximately 200,000 air-pollution-related deaths recorded annually in the United States reflect the unfortunate price that some are forced to pay. Furthermore, research indicates that there are racial and socioeconomic disparities in the extent to which the consequences of fossil-fuel use have a positive or negative impact on individuals\\' lives. Studies show, for example, that White Americans are responsible for 17 percent more air pollution than they are subjected to, while Black and Hispanic Americans are exposed to well over 50 percent more than they cause. The indirect nature of posttax subsidies, however, makes them much harder to deal with than pretax subsidies. And while pretax subsidies are declining worldwide, their removal could be a double-edged sword. Since they do decrease the direct financial burden on consumers, removing them would add stress to low-income households, and in some cases drive very poor individuals to use cheaper fuels that release even greater amounts of pollutants than fossil fuels do. At the same time, these very households experience a disproportionate amount of suffering and hardship as a result of the activity the subsidies encourage. Experts say a more effective strategy for governments is to focus on the broader societal costs. This would impose a degree of accountability on the fossil-fuel industry while easing the impacts on low-income households. It would also, and perhaps more importantly, result in higher prices for fossil fuels, mitigating the degree of damage they cause by incentivizing the research and development of energy from cleaner sources.',\n",
       "  'Taking it for granted that a central nervous system and a brain in particular is a prerequisite for intelligence, scientists have long asserted that only humans and animals are capable of thinking. Based on this view, research into intelligence has been defined by IQ tests and other objective measurements of the ability to do things like answering written questions, solving physical puzzles, and demonstrating memory skills through actions. Proponents of an emerging field known as plant neurobiology, however, have disputed the scientific consensus, arguing that the lack of a central nervous system does not necessarily preclude plants from possessing some form of intelligence. They contend that ordinary biological, chemical, and genetic mechanisms in plants do not adequately explain the wide array of highly sophisticated behaviors that they exhibit. Advocates claim, therefore, that plants are not simply passive elements in their environment, but are, in fact, capable of sensing and assessing stimuli from multiple environmental factors in order to coordinate appropriate responses. Such assertions, however, have been met with skepticism and even outright hostility in the scientific community. Research by Monica Gagliano of the University of Western Australia attempted to validate some of plant neurobiology\\'s controversial claims using the mimosa plant, which is known for defensively curling its leaves in reaction to being touched or disturbed. Gagliano\\'s experiment involved exposing over 50 mimosa plants to weekly sessions of controlled, harmless dropping motions. She observed that, over time, some of the plants stopped reacting defensively, indicating they had learned that danger was not imminent. To discount the possibility that the plants\\' lack of reaction to being dropped could be attributed to fatigue or something similar, Gagliano exposed some of the plants to a sudden shaking motion. Though the process of adapting to being dropped had been gradual, the shaking motion instantly returned the plants to their normal defensive behavior. When she exposed them to the dropping motions again, the plants \"remembered\" what they had previously learned, suggesting that they were purposely altering their response to being dropped based on experience. Research like this supports the growing argument that while plants may not have brains, their behavior in reaction to environmental stimuli is evidence of a brainlike information-processing system. Scientists who support this theory have also noted that, on a biological level, the chemical signaling systems found in the nervous systems of animals have been identified in plants, too.',\n",

       "  'The introduction of European horses to the southern plains of the United States by the Spanish had a transformative impact not just on indigenous tribes\\' cultures but also on the region\\'s economies and power structures. The Comanche tribe, in particular, rose from being an impoverished people to being a military and economic powerhouse. The Comanche came to wholeheartedly embrace a mounted lifestyle, utilizing horses obtained through trade with the Spanish and raiding missions to hunt bison, which were widespread across North America. Native American tribes fought constantly for territory and resources, but by the mid-eighteenth century, the Comanche had become undisputed masters of horseback military tactics, dominating a huge region centered around present-day northwestern Texas. This was in contrast to the neighboring Apache tribe: a similarly powerful but semi-agricultural people who failed to utilize horses or adopt mounted fighting tactics. Radical cultural upheaval was likely more palatable to the Comanche, as they had been subsisting as rudimentary hunter-gatherers with a low social standing among indigenous tribes in the region. The Apache\\'s relative stability, on the other hand, meant there was less incentive for such a radical transformation. And the fact that Apache communities were mostly rooted to one place so they could tend to their farms meant they were highly vulnerable to the Comanche\\'s lightning raids on horseback, which quickly swept the Apache to the edges of the southern plains. Horses also brought an economic and social revolution to the Comanche. The animals became their primary source of wealth, and the surplus of horses the tribe had slowly amassed allowed them to trade this valuable resource with other groups. A hierarchy formed within the Comanche in which a few men accumulated hundreds of horses, allowing these privileged few to support multiple wives and wield significant economic and political power. A second, much larger tier of men owned fewer horses, likely between 10 and 20, and below these men were the impoverished, who depended on loaned mounts for hunting. Although the Comanche tradition of generosity through extravagant gifts meant that these men usually did not suffer materially, the social distinctions that had arisen meant they often lacked access to marriage and other benefits. While profitable, the Comanche\\'s horse economy also created a problem. Many indigenous peoples of the southern plains depended on bison for sustenance and lived a nomadic lifestyle in pursuit of bison herds. According to historian Pekka Hmlinen of the University of Oxford, \"The southern plains tribes were balancing between two economies\"one involving subsistence hunting and the other involving sophisticated trading activities. In order for the Comanche to maintain the large horse surpluses necessary for the latter, land for grazing was required on such an enormous scale that the bison struggled to compete for food and water.

       "  \"In recent years, fears concerning the environmental impact of animal-feed production have been growing. Cultivation of the massive amounts of corn and other crops required to sustain livestock has driven deforestation, biodiversity loss, and chemical pollution of waterways. As the agriculture industry searches for alternatives, insect farming has emerged as a contender in the race to develop more cost-effective and sustainable animal-feed solutions. It is facing resistance, though. Businesses often allocate money saved in one area of operations to expand other areas in the pursuit of greater profits, and the agriculture industry is no different in this regard. Using insects to minimize animal-feed costs would simply encourage the further growth of industrial animal farming and intensify its problems. Critics say that insect farming would facilitate the expansion of a system already notorious for the inhumane treatment of livestock and the overuse of antibiotics in animals  a practice that contributes to the development of drug-resistant bacteria that endanger human health. The fact that industrial animal agriculture has also been singled out as a major cause of climate change  the animals' waste is a major contributor to global greenhouse-gas emissions  only underlines an important point: the adoption of expenditure-cutting measures by the animal agriculture industry in the name of sustainability would exacerbate an already dire situation. There is another reason insect farming is facing pushback. The fact that many animals in the agriculture industry continue to be routinely subjected to unsanitary and cramped conditions, some argue, does little to alleviate concerns that farmed insects would face similar conditions. This is further underscored by studies showing some insects react to stimuli in ways that indicate the existence of complex thought patterns, supporting theories that insects possess a capacity for consciousness and pain perception. And because insects used as feed would need to be reared in immense numbers both to satisfy global demand and to turn a worthwhile profit, some doubt whether corporations incentivized by potential earnings can be trusted to ensure the insects' welfare. This is not to say the benefits of insect farming should be overlooked. A huge amount of food waste ends up in landfills, releasing harmful greenhouse gases as it decomposes. Many insects, however, thrive on such waste, so using it as feed on insect farms would not only cut costs for insect farmers but also mitigate environmental damage. The inability to guarantee a consistently satisfactory product would, in turn, cast a shadow on the commercial feasibility of insect farming, and it would also likely force insect farmers to resort to the very type of traditional feed that insect farming is trying to supplant. Lobbyists, though, say insect farming is not intended to be a silver bullet. They insist that any idea that could potentially curb the well-documented environmental effects of animal-feed production, even to a minor degree, should not be dismissed outright. While the effort to displace such production with insect farming is commendable, the reality is a complicated affair.\",\n",

       "  'As in many other countries, people in India are concerned about the problem of plastic waste. After all, the country produces 5.6 billion kilograms of it every year. The system for managing plastic waste needs improvement because a lot of plastic ends up as trash on land and in waterways such as the Ganges River. In response, the Indian government planned to introduce a ban on plastic items that could only be used once. ( 21 ), though, the government was forced to change its plans because of the condition of the economy and worries about an increase in unemployment. Nevertheless, there is one kind of situation where the use of plastic has come to an end. All 7,000 railway stations in India have replaced plastic teacups with brown clay teacups called kulhads. Long before plastic cups were used in India, people enjoyed drinking tea in these traditional cups. The minister for railways in India ordered railway stations to ( 22 ) kulhads. By doing so, he hopes the country will take an important step toward ending plastic waste. There are several reasons why kulhads are better than plastic teacups. First, after they have been thrown away, they soon break down into substances that do not harm the environment. Second, the clay that kulhads are made from actually improves the flavor of the tea. Finally, using kulhads ( 23 ). Plastic cups are made with machines, but kulhads are made by hand. The Indian government estimates that hundreds of thousands of people will get extra work because of this change.',\n",
       "  \"Parrots are smart and sometimes very colorful birds. They are popular as pets and can often be seen in zoos. Unfortunately, about one-third of parrot species in the wild are in danger of dying out. Examples include hyacinth macaws and Lear's macaws. Each year, some of these birds are caught and sold illegally as pets. ( 24 ), many are dying because the forests where they live are being cleared to create farmland and to get wood. This has reduced the size of the areas in which they can build nests and collect food. A study published in the journal Diversity revealed that hyacinth macaws and Lear's macaws play an important role in the forests. Researchers studying these parrots in Brazil and Bolivia found that they spread the seeds of 18 kinds of trees. They observed the birds taking fruits and nuts from trees and carrying them over long distances.\",\n",

       "  \"Tweed is the name given to a type of thick cloth that was first developed by farmers in Scotland and Ireland. Long pieces of wool are dyed different colors and then put together to make a cloth with a pattern. The weather in Scotland and Ireland is often cold and wet, so this warm, waterproof material was very popular with the farmers as they worked in the fields.Tweed did not become well known outside farming communities until the 19th century. At that time, wealthy English people were buying large areas of land in Scotland. These were known as estates, and they were used by their owners for hunting and fishing. Hunters became interested in tweed because it is mainly brown, green, or gray, so wild animals find it difficult to see people wearing clothes made of the material.The wealthy English owners began having patterns of tweed made for their estates. After Queen Victoria's husband, Prince Albert, had a unique pattern made for the people on a royal estate in Scotland, the cloth became famous throughout the United Kingdom.Clothes made from tweed became standard items for wealthy people to wear in the countryside. Men would wear blue or black suits when doing business in towns and cities, and tweed suits when they went to relax on their estates. Ordinary people began to imitate them by wearing tweed for outdoor hobbies such as playing golf or cycling. The fashion for wearing tweed also spread to the United States and the rest of Europe, and tweed became even more popular in the 20th century when various famous fashion designers used it for their clothes.Tweed remained fashionable for many years, though by the start of the 21st century, its popularity had dropped. However, tweed is now starting to become popular once more. One reason for this is that it does little harm to the environment. In addition to being made from natural wool, it is strong enough to last for a very long time, so people do not often need to buy new clothes. Indeed, some wealthy people in the United Kingdom still wear their grandparents' tweed suits.\",\n",
       "  'These objects are usually parts of tools or weapons, and they show us how these people obtained their food. However, less is known about other parts of their culture. The other source of information we have from this period is paintings on the walls inside caves. These are mostly hunting scenes, so while they show that early humans lived in groups, they do not show that early humans participated in other social activities, such as religious ceremonies. The lack of evidence led many historians to believe that religions did not develop until humans started to build farms and live in villages. A recent discovery, though, suggests that religious beliefs may have existed before this time. The Shigir Idol is a tall wooden statue that has faces and symbols carved into it. Experts say that it is very likely that these symbols express religious beliefs about the gods they worshipped. The Shigir Idol was actually found in Russia in 1890. For a long time, people did not know how old it was, but analysis of the wood in the last few years has revealed that it was made around 12,500 years ago long before humans in the area began farming. The statue was made in several pieces so that it could be taken down and set up again in a different place as the humans who owned it moved around. Unfortunately, some pieces were lost during the early 20th century and only drawings of them remain. At some point in history, the Shigir Idol fell into a kind of mud that kept it safe for thousands of years. The conditions in which it was found are very rare. Indeed, no other wooden statues of a similar age have been discovered. Judging from the quality of the Shigir Idol, early humans were skilled at making things from wood.

       "  'A Simple Solution In the town of Burnham-On-Sea in England, police officer Ashley Jones noticed that there were a number of lonely people. He wanted to find a way to make it easier for these people tostart talking to others. After thinking about the problem, he came up with the idea of turning some of the benches in local parks into \"chat benches.\" He put a sign on each chat bench which says that if someone sits on the bench, that person does not mind having a conversation with a stranger. Only a few days after he set up the chat benches, Jones was happy to discover that his idea was working. People who had never met before were sitting on the benches and talking to each other. The benches are making a big difference, especially tothe lives of elderly people. Many of them live on their own and find it difficult to travel to visit family or friends. In fact, some seniors do not have the chance to have a conversation for days or even weeks. A recent survey found that over 9 million people in the United Kingdom often feel lonely. Many of them find it difficult to make friends because they are scared of speaking to people they do not know. Jones\\'s simple idea provides an easy and attractive way to solve the problem of loneliness.Indeed, chat benches are becoming very popular. More than 40 benches have been set up across the United Kingdom, and the idea is spreading to other countries, such as Australia and the United States.',\n",
       "  'Cows Need Friends Milk production is big business. In North America, for example, one person consumes on average over 150 kilograms of milk every year. To supply the huge amount needed, big farms use machines that automatically feed cows and take their milk. Becausemachines are used, the cost of producing milk is lower. On such farms, though, it is easy for diseases to spread from one animal to another. This can lead to many cows dying on one farm. As a result, cows are often kept separately from a young age. Scientists in Canada researched the effects of keeping young cows in this way. They compared such cows with ones that had been kept with another cow. The researchers showed a red plastic container, which the cows had never seen before, several times to each cow. The cows that had been kept in pairs were interested in the container at first but soon ignored it.By contrast, the cows that had been kept alone continued to react as if it was the first time they had seen the container. The researchers concluded that cows kept alone are more sensitive to new things. This is important news for farmers. If cows cannot get used to the feeding and milking machines, milk production slows down. The researchers believe farmers would have fewer problems with feeding and milking if cows were kept in very small groups, rather than separately. The researchers also say that diseases are not such a big problem for small groups. There should be little risk ofinfectionif only two or three of them are kept together.',\n",

For example, computers and smartphones require rare metals such as gold. The amount of metal available on land, however, is limited. It is expensive for mining companies to dig deep into the ground to find metals. For these reasons, mining companies are now looking for metals under the sea. In the past, finding metals under the sea was considered to be too much of a challenge. In the last few decades, however, places where rare metals can be found have been discovered. These places are called \"hydrothermal sea vents.\" They are created when seawater flows deep inside the earth, where the rocks are very hot. The rocks are made of substances that contain metals. The water absorbs these substances. As the water gets hotter, it rises, pushes through the seafloor, and returns to the ocean. When the hot water mixes with the cold seawater, the substances in it are dropped on the seafloor. Because they are deep in the ocean, hydrothermal sea vents were not discovered until the 1970s. Scientists are interested in them not only because of the metals they contain, but also because of the amazing creatures found living near them. The water around the vents is very hot, dark, and full of powerful acids. In spite of these difficult conditions, bacteria and animals have adapted to live in these places. Unlike almost all other living things on the planet, these special creatures do not depend on energy from the sun. The conditions around the vents mean that mining near them is very challenging. The technology to mine close to the vents now exists, but it is still very expensive. There are other problems with deep-sea mining, too. Scientists believe that sometime soon, companies will be able to afford to mine metals from the seafloor. However, mining around the vents would probably harm the creatures that live there. Consequently, although mining the seafloor for metals will become possible, governments and environmental groups might fight against it and perhaps even try to ban it.',\n",

I know Sylvia had a bad cold a couple of weeks ago, so she missed a few classes. Unfortunately, the students learned some very important things during that week. I sent Sylvia's homework to her while she was absent from school, but she missed some important explanations about triangles during the class. She said she understood the topic, but she did very poorly on yesterday's test. I know that this is not her fault. However, it is very important for her to learn this topic. If she doesn't, she will have trouble in the future because we will use the concepts again in the next chapter. I am available for half an hour before school begins to help students who are having trouble with their schoolwork. Also, math students from West Bridgeville College come to the school library to give free tutoring every Wednesday after school. Sylvia says that you take her to school and pick her up every day. Which would be more convenient for you? Please send me an e-mail and let me know if you'd like to bring Sylvia in earlier or pick her up later on Wednesdays.Sincerely,Mark Tucker\",\n",
       "  'HagfishThe oceans contain many strange and mysterious creatures. One example is the hagfish. Hagfish look like snakes or eels, but their mouths are a special shape, and they have teeth on their tongues. They live deep in the ocean and eat the bodies of fish that have died and sunk to the ocean floor. A hagfish fossil has been found that is 330 million years old. Scientists who study evolution think hagfish are the ancestors of all creatures with backbones, including human beings.In most countries, few people have heard of hagfish. In South Korea, however, hagfish are used in a popular dish. Their meat is cooked in oil and then served with salt. In particular, older Korean men enjoy eating hagfish while drinking alcohol. This has led to overfishing in Asia. As a result, other countries, such as the United States, have begun catching hagfish in their seas and exporting them to Korea. Hagfish skin is also used to make bags, boots, and other products.Hagfish have a special way of protecting themselves from animals that attack them, such as sharks. Hagfish produce a thick liquid which is full of thin fibers. When hagfish are attacked, they shoot out this liquid from small holes in the sides of their bodies. When the liquid mixes with seawater, it rapidly expands, turning into a kind of jelly. This jelly protects the hagfish by making it difficult for the fish that is attacking it to breathe.Douglas Fudge and a group of scientists at the University of Guelph in Canada have seen a possible use for this hagfish liquid. They say that the fibers in the liquid are like very strong silk. They believe that these could be used to replace artificial fabrics, such as nylon, which are made from fossil fuels. The hagfish fibers would be much more environmentally friendly. These scientists are now trying to create similar fibers in the laboratory in order to make a new fabric that is both very strong and light. Clothing manufacturers would be interested in using such a high-quality fabric for their products.',\n",
       "  'Recycling Old IdeasToday, people often recycle items to prevent them from being thrown away in landfills. Recycling metals, in particular, is important because when metals are produced from natural rocks, much harm is caused. Not only is land damaged when taking resources out of the ground, but also many poisons are released into the environment. Furthermore, large amounts of electricity are used. For these reasons, people are looking for ways to recycle metals instead. Recycling metals actually has a long history. It has always been much easier to reuse metals than to produce them. Metals like iron, copper, and tin are common, but they are difficult to separate from the rocks in which they are found. This is why, in ancient times, Roman armies took metal statues from other countries after wars and melted the statues down to make new weapons. Even as late as the 18th century, Americans were encouraged to donate iron items to be recycled for George Washington\\'s army. During the 19th century, large companies specializing in recycling were established to meet a higher demand for metals. However, in the 20th century, producing metals became faster and more efficient. Around this time, many product makers began to change the way they increased their profit. Instead of reducing production costs as usual, they started using an approach called \"planned obsolescence.\" This means making products that are designed to break or become unusable after a short period of time, so customers have to buy products more frequently. These days, such items include devices like smartphones, which must be replaced every few years. They also contain many rare metals. In fact, Americans put around $60 million worth of gold and silver into landfills each year just by throwing away used phones. Although many people already see the importance of recycling large appliances such as refrigerators and washing machines, some do not understand why smaller electronics should be recycled. The amount of metal in the world is limited, so it may be better to learn from old ideas to preserve the world\\'s supply.',\n",

       "  \"Lawson,This is Mark Tucker, your daughter's math teacher at Berkton Middle School. I wanted to talk to you a little about Sylvia's math grades. I know Sylvia had a bad cold a couple of weeks ago, so she missed a few classes. Unfortunately, the students learned some very important things during that week.I sent Sylvia's homework to her while she was absent from school, but she missed some important explanations about triangles during the class. She said she understood the topic, but she did very poorly on yesterday's test. I know that this is not her fault. However, it is very important for her to learn this topic. If she doesn't, she will have trouble in the future because we will use the concepts again in the next chapter.I am available for half an hour before school begins to help students who are having trouble with their schoolwork. Also, math students from West Bridgeville College come to the school library to give free tutoring every Wednesday after school. Sylvia says that you take her to school and pick her up every day. Which would be more convenient for you? Please send me an e-mail and let me know if you'd like to bring Sylvia in earlier or pick her up later on Wednesdays.Sincerely,Mark Tucker\",\n",
       "  'Hagfish. The oceans contain many strange and mysterious creatures. One example is the hagfish. Hagfish look like snakes or eels, but their mouths are a special shape, and they have teeth on their tongues. They live deep in the ocean and eat the bodies of fish that have died and sunk to the ocean floor. A hagfish fossil has been found that is 330 million years old. Scientists who study evolution think hagfish are the ancestors of all creatures with backbones, including human beings. In most countries, few people have heard of hagfish. In South Korea, however, hagfish are used in a popular dish. Their meat is cooked in oil and then served with salt. In particular, older Korean men enjoy eating hagfish while drinking alcohol. This has led to overfishing in Asia. As a result, other countries, such as the United States, have begun catching hagfish in their seas and exporting them to Korea. Hagfish skin is also used to make bags, boots, and other products. Hagfish have a special way of protecting themselves from animals that attack them, such as sharks. Hagfish produce a thick liquid which is full of thin fibers. When hagfish are attacked, they shoot out this liquid from small holes in the sides of their bodies. When the liquid mixes with seawater, it rapidly expands, turning into a kind of jelly. This jelly protects the hagfish by making it difficult for the fish that is attacking it to breathe. Douglas Fudge and a group of scientists at the University of Guelph in Canada have seen a possible use for this hagfish liquid. They say that the fibers in the liquid are like very strong silk. They believe that these could be used to replace artificial fabrics, such as nylon, which are made from fossil fuels. The hagfish fibers would be much more environmentally friendly. These scientists are now trying to create similar fibers in the laboratory in order to make a new fabric that is both very strong and light. Clothing manufacturers would be interested in using such a highquality fabric for their products.',\n",
       "  'Recycling Old Ideas. Today, people often recycle items to prevent them from being thrown away in landfills. Recycling metals, in particular, is important because when metals are produced from natural rocks, much harm is caused. Not only is land damaged when taking resources out of the ground, but also many poisons are released into the environment. Furthermore, large amounts of electricity are used. For these reasons, people are looking for ways to recycle metals instead. Recycling metals actually has a long history. It has always been much easier to reuse metals than to produce them. Metals like iron, copper, and tin are common, but they are difficult to separate from the rocks in which they are found. This is why, in ancient times, Roman armies took metal statues from other countries after wars and melted the statues down to make new weapons. Even as late as the 18th century, Americans were encouraged to donate iron items to be recycled for George Washington\\'s army. During the 19th century, large companies specializing in recycling were established to meet a higher demand for metals. However, in the 20th century, producing metals became faster and more efficient. Around this time, many product makers began to change the way they increased their profit. Instead of reducing production costs as usual, they started using an approach called \"planned obsolescence.\" This means making products that are designed to break or become unusable after a short period of time, so customers have to buy products more frequently. These days, such items include devices like smartphones, which must be replaced every few years. They also contain many rare metals. In fact, Americans put around $60 million worth of gold and silver into landfills each year just by throwing away used phones. Although many people already see the importance of recycling large appliances such as refrigerators and washing machines, some do not understand why smaller electronics should be recycled. The amount of metal in the world is limited, so it may be better to learn from old ideas to preserve the world\\'s supply.',\n",

The special feature of this system is that a central energy source is connected to buildings around it using underground pipes. Those buildings can all be heated together at once using this system. Now, the use of this type of heating is increasing around the world. District heating supporters say that it is a good thing. When many buildings share the same heat source, less heat is needed than when heating buildings separately. If less energy is used for heating, there will be less CO2 released into the air. This reduces global warming effects. There is another benefit of district heating. Heaters sometimes break down, which causes trouble for residents. However, district heating systems are regularly checked and kept in good condition. This makes them more reliable. They are unlikely to stop working suddenly. Despite this, critics point out a problem. Creating new district heating systems involves placing lots of underground pipes, which requires workers to dig deep into the ground. However, doing this in areas that already have buildings is a lot of work. Therefore, construction in such places needs a large amount of money.',\n",

In each season, their diet would consist of different foods. They would, for example, fish in the summer, harvest wild rice in the fall, hunt wild animals in the winter, and gather plants in the spring. This often meant moving their camps to locations where such foods were easy to obtain. This changed once contact was made with European settlers. They introduced new foods and established a different way of life. Europeans farmed the land to grow food instead of eating what was growing naturally in the wild. Over time, much of Native American food culture was lost. Now, there is__Native American cuisine. Indigenous groups are eager to pass on the traditions of their ancestors to future generations so that their history will not be lost. Across the United States, several new restaurants have been created that focus on serving foods that are native to the land. Podcasts and social media posts regularly feature Native American chefs who are sharing cultural dishes.

       "  'Sudden Savant Syndrome Savant syndrome is a rare medical condition in which people have exceptional skills in areas like music, art, or mathematics. Until recently, scientists thought savant syndrome__. People either were born with the syndrome, or they developed it after a serious head injury. However, we now know there is another scenario called sudden savant syndrome. Without explanation, some people suddenly demonstrate amazing skills in areas in which they had no prior interest or ability. Take, for example, the case of a woman in her forties who, one day, suddenly felt an urge to create art. Though she had never taken a class or had any previous experience, she found she could draw amazing pictures with realistic details, much like a professional artist. Her newly acquired skills__. Reportedly, the woman felt the need to draw and paint for hours, ignoring other aspects of her life. She had to work hard to find a balance that allowed her to live with her condition. This overpowering need by people with sudden savant syndrome to act on their extraordinary skills is just one of the many aspects of the syndrome that scientists do not understand, including whether the change is permanent or if it is also found in other family members. With further research, scientists hope to discover what makes individuals with the syndrome unique from others.__, such investigations may reveal that there are actually fewer differences than previously thought.

Studies show a relationship between nutrition and how well students do in school. Therefore, providing a healthy meal for all students is important. Doing this can improve their concentration levels, leading to better test scores. Additionally, free school meal programs have another advantage. Many parents today are often extremely busy, giving them little time to prepare lunches for their children. The programs, therefore, are a huge help. This is because parents of all students will be able to spend more time on work and other child-raising issues. Critics, on the other hand, say that providing school meals for everyone is problematic. Schools need to prepare enough meals every day for all students. However, some students do not completely eat the food that has been prepared. Consequently, a large amount is left over. The schools have no option but to throw it away.',\n",

       "  'The Soccer War In July 1969, there was a short yet intense war between the Central American countries of El Salvador and Honduras following a series of World Cup qualifying soccer matches they played against each other. Although the conflict is often called the \"Soccer War,\" its causes went far beyond sports. Honduras is much larger than El Salvador but is far less densely populated. Since the late 1800s, land in El Salvador had been controlled primarily by elite families, which meant there was little space for ordinary farmers. By the 1960s, around 300,000 Salvadorans had entered Honduras illegally to obtain cheap land or jobs. The Honduran government blamed the immigrants for its economic stresses and removed them from their lands, forcing them out of the country. Wealthy Salvadorans feared the negative economic effects of so many immigrants returning home and threatened to overthrow the Salvadoran president if military action was not taken against Honduras. This, combined with border disputes that had existed for many years, brought relations between the countries to a low point. Tensions were raised further by the media of both countries, which made up or exaggerated stories that fueled their bitterness toward one another. The Salvadoran press accused the Honduran government of cruel and illegal treatment of Salvadoran immigrants, while the Honduran press reported that those same immigrants were committing serious crimes. Such reports were made at the request of the countries\\' governments: in El Salvador, the goal was to convince the public that military force against its neighbor was necessary, while in Honduras, the government wanted to gain public support for its decision to force Salvadoran immigrants out of the country. The World Cup qualifying matches were happening at the same time as the migrant situation was intensifying. On the day of the last match, El Salvador accused Honduras of violence against Salvadorans and cut off relations, and within weeks, El Salvador\\'s military attacked Honduras, beginning the war. Historians note that the term Soccer War was misleading. At the time, the United States was part of an alliance with Central American nations, but it chose to stay out of the war. In fact, according to an American diplomat, the inaccurate belief that a sporting event was behind the conflict led the US government to overlook its seriousness. Issues such as land ownership, which were the true origin of the conflict, remained unresolved. This led to continued political and social instability and, ultimately, a civil war in El Salvador in the following decades.',\n",

Many charities offer them, and it is widely believed that people give more when they receive donor premiums. However, researchers say that donor premiums tend to. Most people initially give money because they want to make the world a better place or help those who are less fortunate. When they receive gifts, though, people can start to become motivated by selfishness and desire. In fact, they may become less likely to donate in the future. There may, however, be ways to avoid this problem. Research has shown that telling people they will receive gifts after making donations is not the best way to ensure they will contribute in the future. In one study, donors responded better to receiving gifts when they did not expect them.future donations from such people increased by up to 75 percent. On the other hand, donors who knew that they would receive a gift after their donation did not value the gift highly, regardless of what it was. Donor premiums may also have indirect benefits. Experts say gifts can. Items such as fancy shopping bags with charity logos, for example, signal that a donor is part of an exclusive group. Such gifts not only keep donors satisfied but also increase the general public's awareness of charities.\",\n",
       "  'Government Policy and Road Safety Traffic-related deaths have declined in the United States due to the introduction of safety measures such as seat belts. Many critics of government policy claim, however, that fatalities could be further reduced with stricter government regulation. In fact, some say current government policies regarding speed limits may. This is because speed limits are often set using the \"operating speed method.\" With this method, speed limits are decided based on the speeds at which vehicles that use the road actually travel, and little attention is paid to road features that could increase danger. Unfortunately, this means limits are sometimes set at unsafe levels. Critics also point out that the United States is behind other nations when it comes to vehicle-safety regulations. In the United States, safety regulations are. Although some vehicles have become larger and their shape has changed, laws have not changed to reflect the increased danger they pose to pedestrians. Critics say that regulating only the safety of vehicle occupants is irresponsible, and that pedestrian deaths have increased even though there are simple measures that could be taken to help prevent them. One measure for improving road safety is the use of cameras at traffic signals to detect drivers who fail to stop for red lights. Many such cameras were installed in the 1990s and have been shown to save lives., the number of such cameras has declined in recent years. One reason for this is that there is often public opposition to them due to privacy concerns.',\n",

       "  \"The Friends of Eddie Coyle In 1970, American writer George V. Higgins published his first novel, The Friends of Eddie Coyle. This crime novel was inspired by the time Higgins spent working as a lawyer, during which he examined hours of police surveillance tapes and transcripts in connection with the cases he was involved in. What he heard and read was the everyday speech of ordinary criminals, which sounded nothing like the scripted lines of TV crime dramas at the time. Higgins learned how real criminals spoke, and their unique, often messy patterns of language provided the basis for The Friends of Eddie Coyle. The novel's gritty realism was far removed from the polished crime stories that dominated the bestseller lists at the time. Higgins neither glamorized the lives of his criminal characters nor portrayed the police or federal agents in a heroic light. One aspect that distinguishes The Friends of Eddie Coyle from other crime novels is that it is written almost entirely in dialogue. Given the crime genre's reliance on carefully plotted stories that build suspense, this was a highly original approach. Important events are not described directly, instead being introduced through conversations between characters in the novel. Thus, readers are given the sense that they are secretly listening in on Eddie Coyle and his criminal associates.

       "  \"The Friends of Eddie Coyle In 1970, American writer George V. Higgins published his first novel, The Friends of Eddie Coyle. This crime novel was inspired by the time Higgins spent working as a lawyer, during which he examined hours of police surveillance tapes and transcripts in connection with the cases he was involved in. What he heard and read was the everyday speech of ordinary criminals, which sounded nothing like the scripted lines of TV crime dramas at the time. Higgins learned how real criminals spoke, and their unique, often messy patterns of language provided the basis for The Friends of Eddie Coyle. The novel's gritty realism was far removed from the polished crime stories that dominated the bestseller lists at the time. Higgins neither glamorized the lives of his criminal characters nor portrayed the police or federal agents in a heroic light. One aspect that distinguishes The Friends of Eddie Coyle from other crime novels is that it is written almost entirely in dialogue. Given the crime genre's reliance on carefully plotted stories that build suspense, this was a highly original approach. Important events are not described directly, instead being introduced through conversations between characters in the novel. Thus, readers are given the sense that they are secretly listening in on Eddie Coyle and his criminal associates. Even action scenes are depicted in dialogue, and where narration is necessary, Higgins writes sparingly, providing only as much information as is required for readers to follow the plot. The focus is primarily on the characters, the world they inhabit, and the codes of conduct they follow.

       "  'A Makeover for Hoover Dam Hydropower has attracted increasing attention in recent years as a renewable type of clean energy. Traditionally, hydropower has been generated by dams, which use water\\'s movement to spin turbines and produce electricity. However, most opponents of hydropower claim that the amount of electricity generated depends on how much water is available in rivers. During periods of drought, reservoir levels can become so low that little or no electricity can be generated. Another problem is that constructing large dams often changes river ecosystems and reduces the amount of water flowing downstream, affecting both wildlife and communities that use the water. One such dam, the Hoover Dam, has supplied electricity to parts of the southwestern United States for decades. However, water shortages caused by a long drought are now threatening its ability to produce electricity. Despite these problems, some experts believe the dam could have a new future as part of a large system for storing and delivering renewable energy. The plan would use solar and wind energy to pump water from below the dam into its reservoir when these energy sources are producing extra power. The water could be released anytime to power the dam\\'s generators in order to reliably meet demand for electricity. Kelly Sanders, an engineering professor at the University of Southern California, is enthusiastic about the storage plan, saying, \"We don\\'t have anything on the horizon as far as batteries of that magnitude.\" Of course, any project as ambitious as this, with its $3 billion price tag for a pipeline and pump station powered by solar and wind energy, is likely to attract objections. Communities downstream from Hoover Dam fear a further reduction in water levels in the Colorado River could endanger jobs in tourism and recreation, and environmental activists have expressed concern that wildlife populations and wetlands could also be impacted by the project. With the urgent need to secure energy sources that can replace fossil fuels, however, the pressure to use hydropower to supplement solar and wind power sources seems sure to intensify. While the project is still in the planning stages, and various governmental approvals are still required, if everything goes as scheduled, the alterations to the dam could be completed by 2028.',\n",

       "  'As long as a suitable water source is available, hydropower facilities are usually good investments, producing energy in a manner that generates far less air pollution and CO2 emissions than fossil fuels do. The most common way to generate hydropower is to trap water at a high elevation behind a dam so it can be released and used to spin turbines below, which, in turn, power electricity-producing generators. However, hydropower has its drawbacks. Droughts and increased water consumption have reduced the flow of many rivers. As rivers become shallower, the necessary volume of water for electricity generation is more difficult to maintain, and power supply and dependability are negatively impacted. Variability in water levels has particularly affected Hoover Dam, a mega-scale hydropower facility in the US state of Nevada. Built in the 1930s at enormous expense to control the frequently flooding Colorado River and maintain a water supply for farmland irrigation, the dam\\'s hydropower capabilities were seen as a way to recover some of the costs of its construction over the long term. The dam\\'s electricity-generating capacity, however, was challenged from the start by seasonal variability in water flow, and in recent years has been greatly reduced by droughts. Combining hydropower with other alternative energy sources, though, may offer a solution. Solar and wind plants can produce enormous amounts of electricity, but one serious downside is that the energy they produce is not available when there is little sun or wind. While conventional batteries can help with this issue, storing such tremendous volumes of electricity has long been a challenge. A recently proposed system for Hoover Dam could provide an answer, though. The plan suggests building a new pumping station that would be powered by both wind and solar. It would push water from the river back up to Hoover Dam, refilling the lake behind it. The water could be released anytime to power the dam\\'s generators in order to reliably meet demand for electricity.

Additionally, there were a tremendous variety of chickens being raised, as farmers generally chose a breed based on how well it was adapted to the local conditions whether it was suited to a dry or a humid climate, for example. After World War II, however, the growing availability of meat such as pork and beef meant eggs could not compete as a source of protein. The US Department of Agriculture therefore set up an event called the Chicken of Tomorrow contest to find a type of chicken that could be raised economically and produced more meat. The overall winner, which was a combination of different breeds, grew faster and larger than other types, and it could adapt to various climates. Inspired by the contest, breeding companies began creating complicated mixtures of chicken varieties to guarantee a consistent supply of birds with these same desirable features. Since producing such genetic combinations was difficult, most farmers had no choice but to purchase young chickens from those companies rather than breeding them by themselves a development that completely changed the industry. The contest helped popularize the consumption of chicken meat, but this trend also had a dark side. It became more economical to raise massive numbers of chickens in large facilities where they were confined in small cages. Not only did this force numerous small farms out of business, but it also created conditions for the birds that, according to animal rights activists, caused the chickens stress and led to higher levels of sickness. While the contest made chicken a regular food item, some people questioned whether it was worth it.',\n",

       "  \"Commonly, students who break rules are given punishments, such as being prohibited from attending classes for a day or more or being made to stay in class after the school day ends. These are designed to teach the students to follow teachers' instructions and respect classmates. Recent psychological studies, however, have determined that as effective as punishment may be in bringing peace to the classroom temporarily, it can intensify the very behavior it is intended to correct when used continually over an extended period of time. Many experts now believe that in order for children to learn to behave appropriately, it is essential that they develop self-control. When students are punished to make them obey the rules, they are being forced to adopt good behavior through external pressure. Self-control, on the other hand, comes from internal motivation, self-confidence, and the ability to be tolerant of others, and using punishment as a substitute for these things can actually delay or prevent their development. Similarly, the use of rewards such as stickers leads to students merely attempting to please the teacher rather than understanding the importance of gaining knowledge and social skills that will help them throughout their lives. In recent years, an increasing amount of research has been backing up these ideas. A region of the brain known as the prefrontal cortex helps us to concentrate on tasks and is responsible for self-discipline and allowing us to consider the consequences of our actions. Research suggests that the prefrontal cortex may be less developed in students with behavioral problems. Fortunately, though, there is evidence that repeated experiences can alter the brain's structure, which suggests that it is also possible to influence the development of the prefrontal cortex. Child-behavior expert Ross Greene believes that when educators change their attitudes so that they actually listen to students' feelings about their bad behavior and encourage them to come up with solutions to the issues they face, this can have a physical effect on the prefrontal cortex. Greene has designed a highly successful program that has greatly reduced behavioral problems at many schools, and as a result of the extensive media coverage his ideas have received in recent years, they are being adopted by more and more educators.\",\n",

       "  \"Robert the Bruce and the Declaration of Arbroath In 1286, the sudden death of King Alexander III of Scotland resulted in a power struggle among various nobles that nearly brought the country to civil war. To settle the matter, England's King Edward I was asked to select a new ruler from among the rivals. Edward, who himself had ambitions to ultimately rule Scotland, agreed only on the condition that the new leader pledged loyalty to him. He chose a noble named John Balliol as the new king, but resentment soon grew as England repeatedly exerted its authority over Scotland's affairs. The turning point came when Edward attempted to force Scotland to provide military assistance in England's conflict with France. When Balliol allied his nation with France instead, Edward invaded Scotland, defeated Balliol, and took the throne. This was the situation faced by the Scottish noble Robert the Bruce as he attempted to free Scotland from English rule. Robert, whose father had been one of Balliol's rivals for the throne, gained political dominance and led a rebellion that drove English forces from Scotland. Robert was crowned king of Scotland in 1306, and although he enjoyed tremendous support domestically, he had angered the Pope, the leader of the Roman Catholic Church. Not only had he ignored the church's requests that he make peace with England, but he had also taken the life of his closest rival to the throne in a place of worship before being crowned king. Scotland's leadership knew that the country would remain internationally isolated and vulnerable without the church's recognition. International acceptance of Scotland's independence would be especially important if the country were to exist in the shadow of a mighty nation like England, which still failed to officially acknowledge Robert as Scotland's king despite having retreated. In 1320, Scotland's most powerful nobles therefore gathered to create a document known today as the Declaration of Arbroath. It proclaimed Scotland's independence and requested the Pope recognize Robert as the country's ruler. The response the nobles received later in the year, however, indicated that the declaration initially had not been effective. The Pope not only refused Scotland's request but also failed to confirm its self-proclaimed independence, although he did urge England to pursue a peaceful resolution in its dealings with the nation. A few years later, however, the declaration's influence contributed to the Pope recognizing Robert and his kingdom after a peace treaty finally freed Scotland from England's threat. Today, the Declaration of Arbroath is one of the most celebrated documents in Scottish history. Some historians even argue it inspired the US Declaration of Independence, although proof of this is lacking. Scholars generally agree, however, that what makes the Declaration of Arbroath so historic is the assertion that the king may rule only with the approval of the Scottish people; specifically, the nobles used the document to boldly insist on their right to remove any ruler who betrayed them. In this sense, the document was a pioneering example of a contract between a country's ruler and its people, in which the ruler was responsible for ensuring the people could live in a free society.\",\n",

It is now generally agreed that Simon was correct overall, however, and would inevitably win on a longer timescale. Today, Ehrlich's prediction has failed to become reality. Thanks to technology, when population growth increases demand for materials, improvements in production methods tend to counter its effects, or substitutes are found. While this seems like positive news, there are worries about the impact of debates like Ehrlich and Simon's. The fact that technology appears to have lessened the effects of population growth is often taken as evidence that humans will also be able to overcome environmental problems in the same way. This is not necessarily the case, however, as the climate crisis shows. Furthermore, the fact that environmental debates are set out in the same way, with extreme warnings of catastrophe, such as global warming, being countered by incredibly optimistic predictions, tends to make constructive dialogue impossible and divide people into two opposing camps.\",\n",
       "  'Meritocracy, a system in which people are rewarded based on talent and effort rather than class or wealth, is widely regarded as an ideal basis for a fair society. Efforts to implement this system in the United States began with noble intentions as institutions, such as elite universities and large corporations, realized that wealthy white males enjoyed an unreasonable degree of privilege. The institutions sought to make themselves more accessible to females, minorities, and people from working-class backgrounds. While these attempts initially led to improved admission and hiring rates for disadvantaged people, there are indications that people with higher incomes have come up with ways to gain an unfair share of educational opportunities. Access to superior schools and private tutoring, after all, greatly increases the odds that their children will be admitted to an elite university, which in turn enhances their earning potential. Although things like college scholarships for minorities may create the illusion of fairness, meritocracy can often be manipulated. Furthermore, it appears that attempts to implement meritocracy can be problematic. In one disturbing psychological experiment, managers were shown statements about a company\\'s values and then instructed to decide on bonus payments for employees. In cases where the statements emphasized that the company was a meritocracy, subjects awarded larger amounts to males than they did to females with identical performance evaluations. When shown statements that did not mention meritocracy, however, this phenomenon did not appear. It has been suggested that this reflects the belief that operating in an organization that emphasizes it is a meritocracy makes people neglect to examine their own behavior, and without this self-assessment, they are more likely to show bias. Critics of meritocracy, such as legal scholar Daniel Markovits, suggest that it even has negative effects on the elite. America\\'s wealthy were once known as the \"leisure class\" because their inheritances and investments allowed them to devote most of their time to recreation. Now, however, as Markovits writes, \"those who manage to claw their way to the top must work with crushing intensity.\" They are constantly monitored and assessed, and if their performance slips, they face the threat of demotion or firing. People in the middle and lower classes are also constantly struggling to move up or maintain their position, and there is so much pressure from the fear that others will take one\\'s place that it seems to be having an effect on people\\'s psychological well-being in all levels of society. America has long had a reputation as an immigrant nation where anyone, regardless of race or social class, could become wealthy, and surveys indicated that most Americans believed that intelligence and hard work were the primary factors that led to success. In recent years, however, surveys have indicated that some two-thirds of Americans are coming to accept that the nation\\'s wealthy hold their position due to advantages gained early in life, while just one-third attribute the wealthy\\'s success mainly to hard work. Furthermore, seven in ten Americans now view poverty as the result of obstacles that people have faced in life rather than a lack of effort.',\n",

       "  \"He was the son of an enslaved woman, and when he was still only a boy, his mother persuaded her owner to send Smalls to work on the docks in Charleston City, believing her son would be safer there. Smalls later married an enslaved woman and had two children, but he constantly feared they would be sold to a different owner and he would never see them again. He was unable to raise enough money to buy his family's freedom, so escape became the only option. In 1861, the American Civil War began between President Abraham Lincoln's Union forces and the southern Confederate States. The Confederates controlled Charleston, and because of his experience working on the docks, Smalls was taken to work on a Confederate ship that carried supplies of weapons and ammunition. This created a situation that gave Smalls the opportunity he had been waiting for. The captain of the ship often went ashore at night, leaving Smalls and the other enslaved crew members alone on the ship. Smalls persuaded the other crew members to join him in a daring escape. Smalls's plan was risky, however. First, he and the rest of the crew had to pick up Smalls's family and leave the harbor without being discovered by Confederate guards. If they managed this, they still risked being fired on by the Union Navy, which had formed a blockade around the harbor to prevent Confederate ships from leaving. Fortunately, during his time working on the ship, Smalls had learned the signals for gaining safe passage through Confederate checkpoints. Once the ship was out of the harbor, he lowered its Confederate flag and replaced it with a white flag of surrender to discourage the Union ships from attacking. The escape was successful, and Smalls not only gained freedom for his family but was also paid half the value of the ship he handed over.\",\n",
       "  \"In 1980, environmentalist Paul Ehrlich and economist Julian Simon made a bet about the future of mankind. Ehrlich predicted that population growth and increased demand for goods would put a strain on limited resources, leading to starvation and catastrophe. Simon, however, did not share Ehrlich's pessimism, arguing that human creativity and intelligence would allow society to obtain the necessary resources or find alternatives. The purpose of the bet, therefore, was to show whose theory was correct. Since Ehrlich's side of the argument was far more familiar to the general public, Simon hoped the bet would attract attention to his side. He bet $1,000 that in a decade, the price of five commonly used metals, including copper and nickel, would be lower. These were chosen because they were often used for manufacturing essential goods and seemed certain to be in short supply if Ehrlich's prediction was correct. Ten years later, Simon won prices of the metals fell by around 50 percent overall when adjusted for inflation. However, economists say that, to some extent, Simon got lucky. If different materials or starting times had been chosen, there would have been numerous scenarios where Simon ended up paying Ehrlich. In the 1990s, for example, factors like the collapse of Communist governments in Eastern Europe led to substantial declines in raw material prices, and in the years following, they tended to rise due to the recovery of the formerly Communist economies and reductions in supply. Therefore, there would have been a large increase in prices over ten years if the bet had been delayed. It is now generally agreed that Simon was correct overall, however, and would inevitably win on a longer timescale. Today, Ehrlich's prediction has failed to become reality. Thanks to technology, when population growth increases demand for materials, improvements in production methods tend to counter its effects, or substitutes are found. While this seems like positive news, there are worries about the impact of debates like Ehrlich and Simon's. The fact that technology appears to have lessened the effects of population growth is often taken as evidence that humans will also be able to overcome environmental problems in the same way. This is not necessarily the case, however, as the climate crisis shows. Furthermore, the fact that environmental debates are set out in the same way, with extreme warnings of catastrophe, such as global warming, being countered by incredibly optimistic predictions, tends to make constructive dialogue impossible and divide people into two opposing camps.\",\n",
       "  'Meritocracy, a system in which people are rewarded based on talent and effort rather than class or wealth, is widely regarded as an ideal basis for a fair society. Efforts to implement this system in the United States began with noble intentions as institutions, such as elite universities and large corporations, realized that wealthy white males enjoyed an unreasonable degree of privilege. The institutions sought to make themselves more accessible to females, minorities, and people from workingclass backgrounds. While these attempts initially led to improved admission and hiring rates for disadvantaged people, there are indications that people with higher incomes have come up with ways to gain an unfair share of educational opportunities. Access to superior schools and private tutoring, after all, greatly increases the odds that their children will be admitted to an elite university, which in turn enhances their earning potential. Although things like college scholarships for minorities may create the illusion of fairness, meritocracy can often be manipulated. Furthermore, it appears that attempts to implement meritocracy can be problematic. In one disturbing psychological experiment, managers were shown statements about a company\\'s values and then instructed to decide on bonus payments for employees. In cases where the statements emphasized that the company was a meritocracy, subjects awarded larger amounts to males than they did to females with identical performance evaluations. When shown statements that did not mention meritocracy, however, this phenomenon did not appear. It has been suggested that this reflects the belief that operating in an organization that emphasizes it is a meritocracy makes people neglect to examine their own behavior, and without this selfassessment, they are more likely to show bias. Critics of meritocracy, such as legal scholar Daniel Markovits, suggest that it even has negative effects on the elite. America\\'s wealthy were once known as the \"leisure class\" because their inheritances and investments allowed them to devote most of their time to recreation. People in the middle and lower classes are also constantly struggling to move up or maintain their position, and there is so much pressure from the fear that others will take one\\'s place that it seems to be having an effect on people\\'s psychological wellbeing in all levels of society. America has long had a reputation as an immigrant nation where anyone, regardless of race or social class, could become wealthy, and surveys indicated that most Americans believed that intelligence and hard work were the primary factors that led to success. In recent years, however, surveys have indicated that some two-thirds of Americans are coming to accept that the nation\\'s wealthy hold their position due to advantages gained early in life, while just one-third attribute the wealthy\\'s success mainly to hard work. Furthermore, seven in ten Americans now view poverty as the result of obstacles that people have faced in life rather than a lack of effort.',\n",

Charles Vance wrote it 30 years ago, so it's a little old. On Saturday, I went to my friend's house, and he told me about your store, The Book Worm. He said that you sold used books.

       "  'Lilian Bland was born in 1878. She was different from most girls at that time. Lilian enjoyed hunting, fishing, and riding horses. She also practiced a martial art and studied art in Paris. In 1900, she moved to Ireland with her father. By 1908, she was working for newspapers in London. In 1909, Lilian\\'s uncle sent her postcards. One of them had a picture of Louis Blriot on it. Blriot was a pilot, and he built his own plane. He was the first person to fly a plane across the English Channel. His plane had an accident when it landed, but Blriot wasn\\'t hurt. His story soon became famous. Lilian saw the postcard and became interested in planes. She decided to design a plane and build it by herself. She used wood and simple things to build the body. Then, she bought an engine and put it on the plane. It took her one year to make the plane, and she finished it in 1910. She named the plane \"Mayfly.\" Then, she flew it for the first time. It stayed 10 meters high in the air for 400 meters. Lilian wanted to build a new plane. However, her father thought that flying was too dangerous for his daughter, so she stopped flying. Then, Lilian got married and moved to Canada. In 1935, she returned to England and enjoyed a simple life there until she died in 1971. Today, people remember her because she was the first woman to build and fly her own plane.',\n",

I want to ask you for some advice, and maybe I'll visit your garden center next week. My husband and I bought a house in Smithville in January. This spring, we want to plant some flowers in front of our house. I don't have much time for gardening every year, so I want flowers that live longer than one or two years. What kind of flowers would be good? Sincerely, Sandra NobleDear Ms. Noble, Thanks for your e-mail. Flowers that live longer than two years are called perennials. We have lots of perennials at Smithville Garden Center. Many of them are easy to take care of, but different flowers need different things. Some flowers need lots of sun, but others don't. Some flowers even like dry soil. You said you wanted to put the flowers in front of your house. How many hours of sunshine does that area get? Is the soil dry? What colors do you like? I'll be at the center every day next week from eight until noon. Best wishes, Gary Logan Manager, Smithville Garden CenterHello Mr. Logan, My front yard has some big trees, so it doesn't get much sun in summer. The soil is a little wet. I'd like to have some pink or blue flowers. I'll come and visit your garden center and speak to you next Wednesday. Sincerely, Sandra Noble\",\n",
       "  \"Phar Lap Around the world, many people love to watch horse racing. Each year, thousands of horses take part in races. Most of them don't win, but sometimes there are horses that become famous. One of these horses was from New Zealand, and his name was Phar Lap. Phar Lap was born in 1926. His father was a champion racehorse, so Phar Lap's owners thought he would run fast, too. But when Phar Lap was young, he was thin and weak, and he lost every race he took part in. His owners weren't happy with him, so they sold him to an American businessman named David J. Davis in 1928. The trainer for Phar Lap was a man from Australia named Harry Telford. When Telford saw Phar Lap for the first time, he was very surprised to see the horse's bad health. However, he thought Phar Lap could become a successful racehorse, so they began training very hard together. Phar Lap became stronger and grew to 174 centimeters tall. Although he lost his first few races in Australia, in April 1929, he finally won his first race, the Maiden Juvenile Handicap in Rosehill. After that, Phar Lap became much more popular with people. Between 1929 and 1931, large groups of people came to watch his races in Australia and other countries. During this time, he won 36 of the 41 races he took part in. He also made many new world records. Because of this, Phar Lap will always be remembered as an amazing racehorse in the history of horse racing.\",\n",

Please put your books in a box and leave the box by the large door at the back of the library. You can bring them any morning. Every afternoon, I bring the boxes of books into the library, and every Wednesday and Friday, I look at the books and choose some for our library. Sometimes, people give us books that we don't need.

       "  \"John James Audubon John James Audubon was a famous painter and bird scientist. He was born in Haiti in 1785, but he grew up in France. When he was a child, he enjoyed painting and nature, and he really loved birds. He also played the violin. When Audubon was 18, Napoleon was the leader of France. At that time, Napoleon told all the young men in France to join the French army. Audubon didn't want to be in the army, so he went to the United States. Audubon lived on a large farm near Philadelphia. There, he started to study birds. He started painting pictures of them, too. Audubon's paintings were special because they were very detailed. He also studied how the birds moved and lived. Later, in 1808, Audubon moved to Kentucky. He owned a store there, but he still painted pictures of birds in his free time. Audubon's store didn't make enough money, so he closed it in 1819. He decided to travel down the Mississippi River. On the way, Audubon painted pictures of the birds that he saw.

       "  'The quokka is a special animal from Australia. They are marsupials, like kangaroos, but smaller. They have round bodies about 45 centimeters long. Their ears are small and round, and they have a black nose. Many quokkas live on Rottnest Island. Rottnest Island is near the city of Perth, and its name came from the Dutch word for \"rat\\'s nest.\" Long ago, a man named Willem de Vlamingh thought quokkas looked like big rats. Quokkas are also found on Bald Island and in other parts of Western Australia. They like living in areas with tall grass, can climb trees, and mostly eat at night. On mainland Australia, the number of quokkas has gone down. This is because the environment has changed there. Also, there are wild cats and foxes that hunt them. The weather is also changing, and this is not good for them. Many people think quokkas are cute, and these days, taking photos with them is popular. This became even more popular after an Australian actor took pictures with a quokka and shared them on the Internet. The morning and the evening are good times to take photos with them. However, some people who want to protect quokkas say there are some important rules for taking photos with quokkas. For example, people should wait for quokkas to come close before they take photos with them, and they should not touch quokkas. Also, they say people should not feed them because human food can make them sick.',\n",

       "  'Insects and other animals often make trouble for farmers. Such animals are known as pests and can be a big problem. They eat the fruits and vegetables that should be sold as food. They also carry diseases to the plants grown on farms.The damagecosts farmers a lot of money. Many farmers use chemicals to keep pests away. These chemicals can be bad for the environment, though. They can kill other creatures. They can also get into the fruits and vegetables that people eat. The owners of the Vergenoegd Low wine farm in South Africa use a different method. They want to stop pests from eating their grapes. At the same time, they do not want any chemicals to get in their wine. Their solution is touse other animalsto remove pests. Every day, a team of over 1,000 ducks is taken to the fields where the grapes are grown. The ducks spend all day walking around the plants and eating the pests. Although ducks have been used to control pests in rice fields in Asia for hundreds of years, the use of ducks in other places is much less common. The ducks used on the Vergenoegd Low wine farm are a special kind. They havemuch shorter wingsthan other kinds of ducks. As a result, they cannot fly away. Using ducks to control pests also has another advantage. Their waste helps the grape plants to grow.',\n",

I would like to speak about your history museum because it is visited by a large number of tourists from both inside and outside the country.Information about the museum's history, events, historic buildings, and exhibitions can be found on your website, but there are a few other things I would like to ask you about. Those include information about what your museum staff does to attract visitors, what makes your museum more attractive than others, and so on.If you don't mind, would you let me have an interview with you and your staff on a day that is convenient for you? Also, may I take some photos of the museum, as I would like to make slides to show in the presentation? If an interview is not possible, I hope you will continue to allow me to ask questions by e-mail.Sincerely,Todd Hamilton\",\n",
       "  'A Unique Italian Village There is a village called Chamois in the north of Italy. It is known as the only village in the country that people cannot get to by car.

In fact, throughout the history of the village, only a small number of people have lived there at any time.The ways to get to the village have been limited for a long time. As Italy\\'s economy improved in the early 1960s, the country\\'s road system also got better. At that time, Chamois was connected with other areas by roads that people went through only by bicycle or on foot.

Yet, roads were never built because most of the local people were against the idea. However, this did not mean people wanted to completely stay away from the other cities.

It is almost always males that perform these behaviors rather than females. Instead, the female watches the male perform and decides whether to choose him as a partner. That is because scientists believe that the quality of a male animal\\'s art or performance is often a good way for the female to select the healthiest male. Females want to choose healthy males because their babies will be stronger and healthier, too. In the case of the puffer fish, scientists still do not really know how females choose the best males. Perhaps they choose the most beautiful circle or the circle on the softest sand. One idea is that the circles provide ideal conditions for puffer fish eggs to grow.

Mrs. Jones asked us to choose a type of bird and then search for information about how these birds live and what they eat. I chose penguins because I'm really interested in them. I hope that's OK with you. We started writing in class. I finished writing about where penguins live. I have also started to prepare pictures for our presentation. We have to have at least ten pictures for the presentation. I will prepare the first five, and you can do the rest. Can you research the food the penguins eat? You need to write around 150 words in addition to preparing pictures for the presentation. Let's meet on Monday so we can work together. I am free after school because there is no soccer practice that day. Can you meet me in the library? Don't forget your computer. We need to show our work to Mrs. Jones before Wednesday's presentation. See you soon, Leo\",\n",
       "  'In 1995, divers swimming in the ocean near southern Japan discovered something unusual. They saw large circles drawn in the sand at the bottom of the sea. The divers did not know what had caused these circles. However, the mystery was eventually solved by some scientists who saw the circles being drawn. The artist was a male fish called a puffer fish. He was using different parts of his body to create the circles. When his work was complete, a female came and laid her eggs in the center. The puffer fish is not the only animal that creates beautiful art. A bird called the bowerbird is another example. They gather colorful objects to build a structure called a \"bower.\" This structure looks like a nest. Other animals perform \"art\" that looks like songs or dances. These animals do not make art for pleasure. The purpose is to attract a partner. There is a risk for animals doing this because it can attract attention from dangerous animals. It is almost always males that perform these behaviors rather than females. Instead, the female watches the male perform and decides whether to choose him as a partner. That is because scientists believe that the quality of a male animal\\'s art or performance is often a good way for the female to select the healthiest male. Females want to choose healthy males because their babies will be stronger and healthier, too. In the case of the puffer fish, scientists still do not really know how females choose the best males. Perhaps they choose the most beautiful circle or the circle on the softest sand. One idea is that the circles provide ideal conditions for puffer fish eggs to grow. Sadly, the circles do not last long. They always make a new circle each time they look for a partner.',\n",
