      "“epic theater.” Though his work was consistently watchable and humorous,\n",
      "Brecht’s plays evolved into acts of rebellion against theatrical conventions of the\n",
      "time. In particular, Brecht sought to overturn the common idea that art should\n",
      "( 29 ). Productions of the time employed detailed props and scenery, utilized\n",
      "plots centered on contemporary subjects, and featured characters that audiences\n",
      "could easily relate to. Brecht’s productions, however, turned traditional\n",
      "scriptwriting and staging on their head, purposely reminding audiences at every\n",
      "turn that they were viewing a heavily dramatized, theatrical interpretation of\n",
      "everyday life rather than a real event occurring before their eyes.\n",
      "Brecht particularly despised the principle of catharsis the release of\n",
      "emotions created when audience members sympathize with characters in ordinary\n",
      "plays. This most harmful of theatrical traditions, he argued, ( 30 ). Brecht\n",
      "therefore employed minimalist scenery and sets, and had his characters address the\n",
      "audience directly or hold up signs expressing their character’s traits. By doing so,\n",
      "Brecht intentionally caused his audience to maintain an emotional distance from\n",
      "the characters and events on stage, creating a highly intellectual theater\n",
      "experience. His dramatic devices, Brecht hoped, would provoke the general public\n",
      "into reflecting thoughtfully on the play’s themes.\n",
      "Brecht’s plays were almost invariably an expression of his political and\n",
      "philosophical principles, foremost among these being the concept that ( 31 ).\n",
      "One way that he conveyed this was through the use of historical material. Brecht\n",
      "felt such subject matter served to make audiences aware that seemingly\n",
      "momentous and universal events, such as wars, come to an end, and that the way\n",
      "those events were interpreted was often very different after the events themselves\n",
      "had ended. Brecht held the view that human civilization was progressing toward a\n",
      "utopian society and believed that theater could act both as a reminder that life is\n",
      "not static and as a motivator to help people work toward such a goal. While his\n",

      "\n",
      "Though widely accepted today, charging interest on loaned money, also known as\n",
      "usury, was once considered a major sin. Usury laws were common in the past, and the\n",
      "Roman Catholic Church in particular was known for harshly resisting the practice during\n",
      "the medieval period, expelling those who were guilty of it from the church.\n",
      "Prohibitions against usury originally arose due to the way that debt and credit were\n",
      "viewed as a system of benevolent aid and trust. People in the poor, rural populations of\n",
      "medieval times formed strong communal ties due to the way that families and friends\n",
      "relied on sharing and lending goods to help one another. Expecting compensation,\n",
      "therefore, for an act that was considered one’s social duty was regarded as morally\n",
      "wrong, and this belief persisted following the shift from goods to money as a medium of\n",
      "exchange. Individuals who were destitute or had suffered financial misfortune, however,\n",
      "were forced to turn to the church or the nobility due to their large reserves of capital.\n",
      "And in keeping with the belief at the time regarding the moral nature of debt and credit,\n",
      "lenders who profited from something that was part of one’s social and religious\n",
      "responsibility were viewed as sinful.\n",
      "Some, however, attempted to circumvent church and legal bans on usury in order to\n",
      "profit from moneylending. Various methods emerged to do so, such as complex schemes\n",
      "that involved repaying loans in foreign currencies to use shifting exchange rates as a way\n",
      "to camouflage earned interest. Another method routinely employed by financiers was the\n",
      "“triple contract.” This was a combination of contracts that, while separately permissible\n",

      "the businesses they had authorized loans to, they were technically earning a profit from\n",

      "scientist approached a committee in charge of bird species classification to advocate for\n",
      "reclassifying the three types into separate species, the committee members faced a\n",
      "dilemma. Were the distinctions sufficient to warrant the creation of two additional\n",
      "species? They eventually added just one. Their decision, however, sparked yet another\n",
      "controversy in the world of taxonomy, the branch of science that deals with identifying\n",
      "and defining the multitude of organisms found in nature.\n",
      "The number of new species identified worldwide has been increasing as\n",
      "technological advances allow for closer examination of Earth’s organisms. The number of\n",
      "bird species in South America alone has grown by over 150 since the year 2000. The vast\n",
      "majority of these, however, were not discovered based on expeditions into the deepest\n",
      "corners of the rain forest. Rather, they were created by reclassifying variants of existing\n",
      "species as a result of breakthroughs in recording technology or genetic classification. And\n",
      "while some argue the nuances detectable in recent years justify such reclassifications,\n",
      "others find the distinctions arbitrary. Bird expert James Remsen sees the current state of\n",
      "bird taxonomy as “trying to make the best of a bad situation,” explaining that “we’re\n",
      "trying to apply artificial barriers on a continuum.”\n",
      "These disputes have renewed debate over the “species problem,” a fundamental issue\n",
      "in taxonomy regarding how to distinguish between species. The problems inherent in the\n",
      "attempts to answer this question underscore Remsen’s view. The Biological Species\n",
      "Concept (BSC), for example, has long been a prominent guideline for biologists, defining\n",
      "a species as organisms that can only successfully reproduce with each other and produce\n",
      "healthy, fertile offspring. Using reproduction in this way to draw distinct lines between\n",
      "species causes complications, though. In cases where species have been split into two or\n",
      "more groups for geographical reasons, proponents of the BSC believe that this isolation\n",
      "justifies distinct species classification. It is impossible, they say, to know if these groups\n",
      "would naturally reproduce with each other because they do not meet.\n",
      "Today, in addition to the BSC, biologists are guided by analysis of both DNA and\n",
      "the evolutionary history of groups of organisms. An example is the taxonomic debate\n",
      "over dingoes in Australia. For centuries, dingoes have been subject to eradication in rural\n",
      "areas due to the threat they pose to livestock. One reason they have not been granted\n",
      "protection is because they are classified as wild dogs, belonging to the same species as\n",
      "domestic dogs. Researchers examined factors including dingoes’ bone structure, genetics,\n",
      "and historical lack of domestication, and in 2019, it was determined that a distinct species\n",
      "designation is warranted. This contradicted previous findings that were based on the BSC\n",
      "and which argued that dingoes’ interbreeding naturally with domestic dogs shows they are\n",
      "not a distinct species. Considering dingoes’ important role in controlling populations of\n",
      "pests such as foxes, the issue shows how taxonomic classification can have major\n",
      "implications both for the management of species and for entire ecosystems.\n",
      "\n",
      "(35) Why does the author of the passage mention the controversy that arose over the\n",
      "classification of striolated puffbirds?\n",
      "1 It is an example of the issues related to classifying birds solely based on\n",
      "less­remarkable things like their appearance instead of more­important factors.\n",
      "2 It shows that the minor distinctions between varieties of animals can make\n",
      "it difficult to be certain if new species classifications are appropriate.\n",
      "3 It is an example of the problems that occur when scientists reject existing\n",
      "information about birds in favor of new data gained through fieldwork.\n",
      "4 It shows that many of the small differences once thought to be significant in\n",
      "classifying species are not actually important at all.\n",
      "\n",
      "(36) The Biological Species Concept can be problematic because\n",
      "1 the opportunities that would normally exist for members of the same species\n",
      "to reproduce are sometimes affected by external factors.\n",
      "2 it was established based on observations of interbreeding between animals\n",
      "kept in captivity rather than observations of animals in their natural habitats.\n",
      "3 classification factors designed to apply to a specific species are often\n",
      "mistakenly applied to many different organisms.\n",
      "4 the guidelines it is based on do not attempt to address the basic question of\n",
      "how to assess whether a group of organisms is a distinct species.\n",
      "\n",
      "(37) What is evident from the situation concerning dingoes?\n",
      "1 Close analysis of an animal’s breeding habits over a long period of time\n",
      "can reveal the importance of that animal to the ecosystems it inhabits.\n",
      "2 The 2019 research findings will likely result in Australian farmers being\n",
      "given more rights to exterminate dingoes that attack their livestock.\n",
      "3 Judgments related to the classification of species are likely to be ignored if\n",
      "it is clear that maintaining animal populations leads to economic gain.\n",
